# Dynamic Task List

A simple web application for managing tasks dynamically. You can add tasks, mark them as complete, and delete them when they are no longer needed.

## Features

- **Add Task**: Enter a task in the input field and click "Add" to add it to the list.
- **Complete Task**: Mark a task as complete by checking the checkbox next to it. Completed tasks will be styled differently.
- **Delete Task**: Remove a task from the list by clicking the "Delete" button.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: The structure of the application.
- **CSS**: Basic styling for the application (assumed to be in `styles.css`).
- **JavaScript**: Adding interactivity to the application.
